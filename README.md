## Why

Whether you're stacking free tiers from 18+ providers (~1.7 billion tokens per month across 100+ models) or routing paid premium models through a single intelligent endpoint — API-Gateway handles it the same way. Free or paid, one endpoint or twenty, the routing engine doesn't care. It learns which models deliver and routes accordingly.

**The problem:**

- Juggling dozens of SDKs, rate limits, and failure modes by hand
- One provider flakes and your app breaks
- Blow through a daily cap at 9 AM and discover it at noon
- Every key exhausted? Most gateways just give up and return an error
- No visibility into which model actually performed best for your workload

**API-Gateway solves this:**

- One OpenAI-compatible endpoint routes across every provider you configure — free tiers, paid APIs, or both mixed together
- An adaptive engine learns which models deliver and routes accordingly
- Per-key budget tracking *before* the request goes out — never blow through a cap again
- When every key is exhausted, it drops to recovery mode and self-heals — your app never sees an error
- A dashboard to manage keys, reorder your cascade, edit any model, and watch analytics in real time

## Features

| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Adaptive routing engine** | Scores every model on reliability × speed × intelligence using Thompson sampling. Five presets: balanced, smartest, fastest, most-reliable, or fully custom weights. Or manual priority. | The router gets smarter the more you use it. No static list to maintain. |
| **Per-key budget tracking** | Tracks RPM, RPD, TPM, TPD per `(provider, model, key)` *before* the request goes out. | You never blow through a daily cap. The router always picks a key with capacity. |
| **Self-healing key rotation** | Three retries per key. When all keys are exhausted, drops to 1-RPM recovery mode — probing until one recovers. | Your app never sees an error, even when every key hits its daily limit. |
| **Intelligent cascade** | On 429, 5xx, or timeout: flat 90-second cooldown on the key, cascade to the next model. Cooldowns are per-key, not per-model. | One rate-limited key never benches the whole provider. Other keys stay available. |
| **Typed fallback chains** | Define explicit fallback chains per request via the `fallback` field. Routes the primary model, cascades through your chain on failure. | Predictable routing for workflows that need a specific model with controlled fallback. |
| **Context-aware selection** | Skips models with insufficient context window, no vision for images, or no tools for tool calls. | Your request never lands on a model that will mangle it. |
| **Sticky sessions** | Multi-turn conversations stay on the same model for 30 minutes. | No hallucination spike from mid-conversation model switches. |
| **Context handoff** | When a session must switch models, injects a compact system message so the new model knows it's continuing an existing task. | No "let me start over." Off by default; `API_GATEWAY_CONTEXT_HANDOFF=on_model_switch`. |
| **Key health monitoring** | Periodic probes mark keys healthy, rate-limited, invalid, or error. Successful requests promote keys back to healthy. | Dead keys are skipped automatically. The system recovers from transport hiccups without intervention. |
| **Concurrency gating** | Cap concurrent requests per provider. | A slow endpoint never starves faster ones of connection slots. |
| **Encrypted key storage** | AES-256-GCM before touching the database. Decryption in-memory at request time only. | Your provider keys never sit in plaintext. |
| **Error redaction** | Strips key fragments, account IDs, high-entropy tokens, and internal URLs from provider error responses. | Sensitive data never leaks to your client. |
| **Per-client-key auth** | Issue multiple dashboard-level client keys, each with its own spend cap and label. Apps authenticate with an `api-gateway-...` bearer token. | Multi-app isolation without multi-tenant overhead. Each app gets its own key and budget. |
| **Tool call repair** | Automatic correction for JSON Schema mismatches and rescue for inline tool-call dialects. | Fewer broken tool loops. |
| **Embeddings with family routing** | `/v1/embeddings` routes by model family. Cascade only walks providers serving the same model. | Never silently corrupts your vector store by switching embedding models. |
| **Batch audio transcription** | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/v1/audio/translations` passthrough with family routing. Family-routed ASR catalog: ships with Groq and Mistral whisper/voxtral families; add providers per family in the dashboard or via config import. Client-key allowlists and $-budgets enforced like chat. | Transcribe or translate audio through the same gateway, keys, and budgets as your chat traffic. |
| **Full config export/import** | One JSON file: models, cascade, providers, keys (optionally passphrase-encrypted), routing strategy, embeddings. Dry-run preview, atomic import with rollback. | Move your entire setup between machines safely. |
| **Response caching** | Exact-match cache for temp-0 requests. `X-API-Gateway-No-Cache` to bypass. | Zero-latency repeat responses, zero upstream spend on identical requests. |
| **Anthropic-format inbound** | `/v1/messages` accepts Anthropic-format requests and translates to OpenAI internally. | Use the Anthropic SDK directly without switching your endpoint. |
| **Prometheus metrics** | `/metrics` endpoint with request counts, latency histograms, routing stats. `METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN` for external scraping. | Drop-in for Grafana / alerting without a sidecar. |
| **Signed async webhooks** | Register webhook receivers for routing events. HMAC-SHA256 signed payloads. | Build automations around key exhaustion, model switches, and routing decisions. |
| **Request queueing** | Per-provider concurrency queue with fair scheduling. Configurable via `/api/queue`. | Burst traffic is queued, not dropped. Slow providers don't starve fast ones. |
| **Circuit breaker** | Per-provider circuit breaker with configurable thresholds. Open/half-open/closed states via `/api/circuits`. | Failing providers are tripped automatically, reducing wasted upstream calls. |
| **WebSocket Realtime API** | `/v1/realtime` WebSocket endpoint for OpenAI Realtime API sessions. | Audio and streaming conversations through one gateway endpoint. |
| **Spend-cap budgets** | Set monthly spend limits per client key, or one global cap across all requests. `/api/budgets` for management. | Never exceed your budget. Alerts and auto-cutoff when the cap is reached. |
| **Tag/metadata filtering** | `X-API-Gateway-Tags` header filters the routing chain to models with matching tags. | Route to specific model subsets (e.g. "coding only", "fast only") per request. |
| **TTFT-per-token routing** | Scoring blends time-to-first-token and per-token latency, not just total time. Anti-herd randomization prevents all clients choosing the same model. | Better latency for streaming. Natural load distribution across providers. |
| **Outbound Retry-After** | On 503, the gateway sends `Retry-After` to the client and cascades to the next model simultaneously. | Clients don't retry into the same failing provider. |
| **Privacy Layer** | Outbound redaction (known secrets → placeholders), AI interceptor (detects new secrets), prompt compression (SmartCrusher + TOON). All default OFF, per-direction. | Secrets never reach upstream providers. Compression cuts tool-output tokens 50-80%. |

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MLuqmanBR/api-gateway.git
cd api-gateway
npm install
cp .env.example .env

# Replace the placeholder encryption key with a real one
node -e "const c=require('crypto');const k=c.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');const fs=require('fs');let e=fs.readFileSync('.env','utf8');e=e.replace('ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-64-char-hex-key-here','ENCRYPTION_KEY='+k);fs.writeFileSync('.env',e);console.log('ENCRYPTION_KEY set to '+k)"

npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (the Vite dev UI), add your provider keys on the **Keys** page, reorder your **model cascade** to taste, and grab your unified API key from the **Keys** page header. That unified key is what you point your OpenAI SDK at.

> **Reaching the dev UI from another device on your LAN?** Use `npm run dev:lan` — it passes `--host` through to Vite, which then prints a `Network: http://<your-ip>:5173` URL you can open from a phone or another machine. (Plain `npm run dev -- --host` does *not* work here: the root `dev` script is a `concurrently` wrapper, so the flag never reaches Vite.) API calls go through Vite's dev proxy, so no extra server config is needed.

For a production-like run (server + dashboard both served on `:3001`):

```bash
npm run build
node server/dist/index.js
```

### CLI (`api` command)

API-Gateway ships a CLI for managing the server as a background process:

```bash
# Make the `api` command available in your shell:
# (npm install must be run first — the CLI needs tsx in node_modules)
npm link

# Start/stop/restart the server in the background:
api start
api stop
api restart
api status
api logs
```

The CLI auto-builds on `api start` if the build is missing, reads the port from `.env`, and rotates the server log (capped at 50 MiB with 3 archived copies). For a full command list run `api help`.

`ENCRYPTION_KEY` is required for startup. The server only falls back to a database-stored development key when `NODE_ENV` is not `production`; do not use that fallback with real provider keys.

Request analytics are retained for 90 days or 100000 request rows by default, whichever limit prunes first. Set `REQUEST_ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS=0` or `REQUEST_ANALYTICS_MAX_ROWS=0` in `.env` to disable either retention limit.

## Using the API

Any OpenAI-compatible client works. Point it at `http://localhost:3001/v1` and use your unified `api-gateway-...` key.

**Python**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:3001/v1",
    api_key="api-gateway-your-unified-key",
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",  # let the router pick; or specify e.g. "gemini-2.5-flash"
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the fall of Rome in one sentence."}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
print("Routed via:", resp.headers.get("x-routed-via"))
```

**curl**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer api-gateway-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]
  }'
```

**Streaming**

```python
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Stream me a haiku about SQLite."}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
```

**Tool calling**

Pass OpenAI-style `tools` and `tool_choice`; the assistant response round-trips back through the proxy exactly like the OpenAI API. Multi-step flows (assistant `tool_calls` → `tool` role follow-up → final answer) work across every provider the router can reach.

```python
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather for a city.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["city"],
        },
    },
}]

# 1. Model asks for a tool call
first = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Karachi?"}],
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="required",
)
call = first.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]

# 2. You execute the tool, feed the result back
final = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Karachi?"},
        first.choices[0].message,
        {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": call.id, "content": '{"temp_c": 32, "cond": "sunny"}'},
    ],
    tools=tools,
)
print(final.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Vision / image input**

Send images with the standard OpenAI `image_url` content blocks (base64 `data:` URLs or `http(s)` URLs). When a request contains an image, the router restricts itself to **vision-capable models** and ignores text-only ones. Vision models are tagged with a **Vision** badge on the cascade page.

```python
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",  # auto-routes to a vision model
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,<...>"}},
        ],
    }],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

If no vision-capable model is enabled in your cascade, an image request returns a clear `422` (`code: "no_vision_model"`) rather than silently dropping the image.

Every response carries an `X-Routed-Via: <platform>/<model>` header so you can see which provider actually served each call. The `/v1/responses` route also sets `X-Fallback-Attempts: N` when it cascaded between providers.

### Embeddings

`/v1/embeddings` is OpenAI-compatible, with one deliberate difference from chat routing: **the cascade never crosses models.** Vectors from different models live in incompatible spaces — silently switching models would corrupt any vector store built on top of the proxy. So embeddings route by **family** (one model identity + dimension), and the cascade only walks the providers serving that same family.

```python
resp = client.embeddings.create(
    model="auto",          # default family; or a family name like "bge-m3"
    input=["the quick brown fox", "pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs"],
)
print(len(resp.data), "vectors of", len(resp.data[0].embedding), "dims")
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer api-gateway-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "auto", "input": "hello world"}'
```

`model` accepts `auto` (the configured default family), a family name, or a provider-specific model id (which resolves to its family). Available families:

| Family (`model`) | Dims |
| --- | --- |
| `gemini-embedding-001` *(default)* | 3072 |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 3072 |
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 |
| `embed-v4.0` | 1536 |
| `bge-m3` | 1024 |
| `qwen3-embedding-0.6b` | 1024 |
| `nv-embedqa-e5-v5` | 1024 |
| `llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2` | 2048 |
| `llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2` | 2048 |
| `embeddinggemma-300m` | 768 |

The default family, per-provider toggles, and priorities live on the dashboard's **Models → Embeddings** page.

## Bring your own provider

Add any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible HTTP endpoint as a provider — a paid SOTA API (frontier models from any lab), a local model server on your LAN, a free-tier cloud service, or anything in between. It gets the same adaptive routing, the same cascade behavior, the same per-key budget tracking as every built-in. From the dashboard's **Keys** page:

- **Add Provider** — slug, display name, base URL, API format (OpenAI or Anthropic), optional rate limits and concurrency caps.
- **Auto-discovery** — models are pulled from `/v1/models` on creation. Re-run anytime. Or register models manually.
- **Full model editing** — every model (built-in or custom) is editable: ranks, tools/vision flags, context window, rate limits. Changes take effect immediately.
- **Composite keys** — `account_id:api_key` format with `{account_id}` URL substitution for providers that need it.
- **Clean deletion** — removing a custom provider cascades: drops all models, keys, and cascade entries.

## Settings & backup

One versioned JSON envelope exports your entire configuration: models, cascade order, providers, keys (optionally passphrase-encrypted under PBKDF2-SHA256-310k + AES-256-GCM), routing strategy, and embedding families. Import with dry-run preview and atomic rollback.

<details>
<summary><b>Config API & merge modes</b></summary>

Endpoints behind `/api/config` (gated by dashboard session):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/config/inventory` | Row counts per exportable section |
| `POST /api/config/export` | Build an envelope. Body: `{ sections, passphrase, label, download }` |
| `POST /api/config/preview` | Parse + validate without committing. Returns section counts and encryption status |
| `POST /api/config/import` | Apply an envelope. Body: `{ envelope, options: { mode, dryRun, passphrase, sections? } }`. Single SQLite transaction, atomic rollback. |

Merge modes:

- **skip-existing** *(default)* — never touch rows that already exist. Safest.
- **overwrite** — update existing rows in place, insert the rest.
- **replace** — wipe the destination section, then insert from the envelope.

Every import supports `dryRun: true` — runs inside a `SAVEPOINT`, rolls back, returns a diff summary. Always dry-run first against a populated database.

```

1. Your app sends a request with a single `api-gateway-...` bearer token.
2. The routing engine scores every enabled model (Thompson-sampling Beta posterior for reliability, blended with speed and intelligence), filters out models that can't handle the request, and picks the best key with capacity.
3. **Middle layer** (opt-in): known secrets are redacted to placeholders before the request leaves; tool outputs are compressed via SmartCrusher/TOON. After the response, placeholders are restored to real values.
4. On 429, 5xx, or timeout: cooldown the key, cascade to the next model. On total exhaustion: drop to 1-RPM recovery mode until a key recovers.
5. The response streams back with `X-Routed-Via` and `X-Attempted-Models` headers showing which providers served or were attempted.

## When to use · When to skip

- Want to aggregate capacity across many providers behind one endpoint — free tiers, paid APIs, or both
- Are building an app and don't want to hardcode a single provider
- Want routing that adapts to real-world performance, not a static priority list
- Need your app to keep working when providers fail or rate-limit
- Want to mix free and paid models in one cascade (free for drafts, paid for hard problems)

**Skip it if you:**

- Need a managed cloud service — it's self-hosted only
- Need an admin dashboard for multiple operators — the gateway has one admin; multiple apps and clients can connect through it, but there's no multi-operator RBAC

## Contributing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # server on :3001, dashboard on :5173, both with HMR
npm test         # server vitest + client typecheck (tsc --noEmit) + client eslint
npm run build    # compile server and dashboard
```

PRs should include a test, keep the existing test suite green, and match the tsconfig defaults already in the repo. Issues and discussions are open.

## Disclaimer

**This project is for personal experimentation and learning, not production.** Free tiers exist so developers can prototype against them; they aren't a stable, supported inference substrate and shouldn't be treated as one. If you build something real on top of API-Gateway, swap in a paid API before you ship. Your relationship with each upstream provider is governed by the terms you accepted when you created your account — those terms still apply when the traffic is proxied through this project, and you're responsible for complying with them.
